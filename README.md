# 1. Info

# Description: This Python code represents a program for a small finance company that provides two financial calculators: one for investment and another for home loan repayment. 
# Here's a short description of the code:
# The program starts by displaying a menu with two options: "Investment" and "Bond." 
# The user is prompted to enter their choice by typing either "Investment" or "Bond." If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed.

# If the user selects "Investment," they are prompted to enter the amount they want to deposit, the interest rate (in percentage), 
# the number of years for the investment, and whether they want to calculate "Simple" or "Compound" interest. 

# The program performs the appropriate calculations based on the user's inputs and displays the total amount after the investment period.
# If the user selects "Bond," they are prompted to enter the value of the house, the interest rate (in percentage), and the number of months they wish to repay the loan. 
# The program calculates the monthly repayment amount using the provided inputs and displays the result.

# Overall, this program allows users to calculate the interest gained from an investment or the monthly repayment amount for a home loan based on their input values.

# 2. Installation

# To install and use your project, follow these steps:

# 1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# 2. Download the project files from the designated source or repository.

# 3. Extract the project files to a directory of your choice.

# 4. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory 
# using the `cd` command. For example, if the project is located in the "finance-project" directory on your desktop, you would use the following command:
  
# cd Desktop/finance-project
  

# 5. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended). A virtual environment helps keep project dependencies separate from your system's Python installation. 
# To create a virtual environment, run the following command:
   
# python -m venv myenv
   

# 6. Activate the virtual environment. Run the appropriate command based on your operating system:
# - For Windows:
#  myenv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux:
# source myenv/bin/activate

# 7. Install the project dependencies. Run the following command to install the required dependencies listed in the project's `requirements.txt` file:

# pip install -r requirements.txt
  
# 8. Once the dependencies are installed, you can now run the project. Use the following command:
  
# python your_project_file.py

# Replace `your_project_file.py` with the actual name of the Python file containing your project code.

# 9. The project should now be running, and you can interact with it according to the provided instructions and prompts.

# Make sure to provide any additional setup instructions or configuration steps if necessary. 
# Additionally, it's recommended to include a README file with clear instructions for users to install and use your project.

# 3. Usage Instructions

# Usage

# 1. Open a command prompt or terminal.

# 2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
#  cd path/to/your/project/directory
   
# 3. Activate the virtual environment (if you created one during installation):
# - For Windows:
    
# myenv\Scripts\activate
     
# - For macOS/Linux:
     
# source myenv/bin/activate
     

# 4. Run the project:
  
# python your_project_file.py
   
# Replace `your_project_file.py` with the actual name of the Python file containing your project code.

# 5. The program will start and display a menu with two options: "Investment" and "Bond."

# 6. To calculate the investment gain:
#   - Select "Investment" by typing `investment` and press Enter.
#   - Enter the amount you want to deposit (e.g., `10000`).
#   - Enter the interest rate (e.g., `5.5` for 5.5%).
#   - Enter the number of years for the investment (e.g., `3`).
#   - Choose between "Simple" or "Compound" interest by typing `simple` or `compound`.
#   - The program will calculate the total amount and display the result.

# 7. To calculate the home loan repayment:
#   - Select "Bond" by typing `bond` and press Enter.
#   - Enter the value of the house (e.g., `250000`).
#   - Enter the interest rate (e.g., `4.25` for 4.25%).
#   - Enter the number of months you wish to repay the loan (e.g., `240` for 20 years).
#   - The program will calculate the monthly repayment amount and display the result.

# 8. Follow the prompts and input the required values accordingly. The program will provide the calculated results based on your inputs.

#   Note: Ensure that you provide the values in the correct format as specified by the prompts (e.g., numeric values without symbols or units).

# 9. You can repeat steps 5 to 8 as needed to perform additional calculations or switch between investment and bond calculations.

# That's it! You have successfully used the project to calculate investment gains and home loan repayments. 
# Feel free to explore the different options and experiment with various input values.

# If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please refer to the project documentation or reach out to the project's support team for assistance.
